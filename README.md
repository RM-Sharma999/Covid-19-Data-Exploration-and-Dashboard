# Covid-19 Data Exploration and Dashboard 

This project features an **interactive Tableau dashboard** that examines the **global impact of COVID-19** from **2020 to 2024**, focusing on infection trends, mortality, and vaccination coverage. The dashboard allows users to explore patterns across **countries, continents, and time**, offering clear, data-driven insights into how the pandemic unfolded worldwide.

### [Covid-19 Interactive Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/Covid-19Dashboard_17201999956250/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## Objective
The dashboard is designed to answer key analytical questions, including:
- What are the global totals for **COVID-19 cases, deaths, and fatality rate**?
- How did the pandemic affect **different continents and countries**?
- Which countries were **most severely impacted**?
- How did **vaccination coverage vary globally**?
- Which countries remained **below 50% vaccination** by 2024?
- How did **India’s vaccination campaign** progress over time?

## Data Analysis AND Visualization
I utilized **data analysis** techniques to explore the **COVID-19 dataset** and used the insights gained to build **interactive visualizations** in **Tableau**. These visualizations highlight key trends in **infections**, **deaths**, and **vaccination progress** across **countries** and over **time**.

### Covid-19 Global Numbers
A Simple Tabular view representing **Total Cases**, **Total deaths**, and **Death Percentage** Globally.

### Total Deaths per Continent
A horizontal bar graph representing the **six continents** affected by covid-19, with **Europe** being the continent with highest number of deaths which counts up to **2,100,105 deaths** followed by **North America, Asia, South America, Africa**, with **Oceania** being the continent with least numbers of deaths which counts up to **33,153 deaths**.

### Infection Rate Per Country
A World Map that displays the **covid-19 infection rate** across various **countries**, the map uses a **color gradient** to represent the infection rate with the legend on the top right corner indicating the range from **0.00 to 77.10 percent**.

**Key Observations:**
- **High infection rates** are concentrated in **Western Europe**.
- **Moderate infection rates** are observed in parts of **North America, South America, and Australia**.
- **Lower infection rates** are common across many **African and Southeast Asian countries**.

This map visually illustrates the **global spread and severity of COVID-19**. **Darker shades** represent regions with **higher infection rates**, while **lighter shades** indicate **lower levels of infection**, reflecting differences in transmission, public health measures, and reporting.

### Top Seven Globally Infected Countries
A line graph showing the **top seven most affected countries** by COVID-19. The **x-axis** represents the timeline from **2020 to 2024**, while the **y-axis** displays the **infection rate**.

**Overall Observations:**
- **Steep increases** are seen in **France, Germany, and the United Kingdom**, followed by stabilization.
- **Gradual increases** occur in the **United States and Russia**.
- **Low infection levels** are maintained by **China** with only slight growth.
- **India** shows a **notable decline** to near zero by 2024.

### Countries With less than 50% Vaccination By 2024?
This world map shows **countries projected to have less than 50% vaccination coverage by 2024**. A **color gradient from green to red** represents vaccination levels, where green indicates coverage near the 50% threshold and red highlights those with the lowest. The legend ranges from **0.00% to 49.26%**, providing clear interpretation of the scale.

The map highlights large portions of **Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe** as having low vaccination coverage, with notable countries including **Afghanistan, the Central African Republic, and Papua New Guinea**. Interactive elements allow users to explore different regions and gain deeper insight into global vaccination disparities.

### Covid-19 Full Vaccination Coverage Worldwide By 2024?
This world map displays **projected full vaccination rates by 2024** using a **color gradient from red to green**, where green represents **near-complete (100%) coverage** and red indicates **minimal or no vaccination**.

Countries in **North America, Europe, and parts of Asia** show **high vaccination coverage**, while regions in **Africa and the Middle East** appear in red and orange, reflecting **lower coverage levels**. The legend ranges from **0.0% to 100.0%**, and the interactive **Map Selector** allows users to switch between different views for deeper exploration.

### Vaccinations Administered till May 1, 2024 - India
This line chart shows the **cumulative COVID-19 vaccinations in India** from **November 2019 to May 2024**. It includes three lines representing the **first dose**, **second dose**, and **total doses administered**, with values displayed in **millions** over time.

**Key Observations:**
- The **first dose** shows a rapid increase starting in early 2021, leveling off around **1.4 billion** by mid-2022. 
- The **second dose** grows more gradually, reaching approximately **790 million** by May 2024.
- The **total doses administered** exceed **2.2 billion** by May 2024, reflecting the overall scale of India’s vaccination effort.

This visualization highlights the **speed and scale of India’s vaccination rollout**, as well as the gap between first and second dose coverage.

## Conclusion

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant global impact, with infection rates and trends varying widely across countries. This project analyzes and visualizes COVID-19 data to better understand the **spread and severity of the virus** across different regions, as well as the **vaccination efforts** undertaken by each country.
