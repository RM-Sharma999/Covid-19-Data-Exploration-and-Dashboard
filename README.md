# COVID-19 Tableau Visualization 

This project features an **interactive Tableau dashboard** that examines the **global impact of COVID-19** from **2020 to 2024**, focusing on infection trends, mortality, and vaccination coverage. The dashboard allows users to explore patterns across **countries, continents, and time**, offering clear, data-driven insights into how the pandemic unfolded worldwide.

### [Covid-19 Interactive Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/Covid-19Dashboard_17201999956250/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## Objective
The dashboard is designed to answer key analytical questions, including:
- What are the global totals for **COVID-19 cases, deaths, and fatality rate**?
- How did the pandemic affect **different continents and countries**?
- Which countries were **most severely impacted**?
- How did **vaccination coverage vary globally**?
- Which countries remained **below 50% vaccination** by 2024?
- How did **India’s vaccination campaign** progress over time?

**Visualization 1**: *Covid-19 Global Numbers* \
A Simple Tabular view representing Total Cases, Total deaths and Death Percentage Globally.

**Visualization 2**: *Total Deaths per Continent* \
A horizontal bar graph representing the six continents affected by covid-19, with Europe being the continent with highest number of deaths which counts up to 2,100,105 deaths followed by North America, Asia, South America, Africa, with Oceania being the continent with least numbers of deaths which counts up to 33,153 deaths.

**Visualization 3**: *Infection Rate Per Country* \
A World Map that displays the covid-19 infection rate across various countries, the map uses a color gradient to represent the infection rate with the legend on the top right corner indicating the range from 0.00 to 77.10 percent.

Key Observations:
- High Infection Rates: Western Europe stands out with some of the highest infection rates.
- Moderate Infection Rates: Observed in parts of North and South America, as well as Australia.
- Lower Infection Rates: Predominant in many African and Southeast Asian countries.

This map provides a visual representation of the spread and severity of COVID-19 across the globe. The darker red areas highlight regions with significant infection rates, potentially indicating higher transmission rates or larger outbreaks. Lighter colors indicate regions with lower infection rates, which could be due to effective control measures, lower transmission rates, or other factors.

**Visualization 4**: *Top Seven Globally Infected Countries* \
A line graph representing the top 7 most affected countries by covid-19, the x-axis represents the timeline from 2020 to 2024, while the y-axis shows the infection rate.

Overall Observation:
- Steep Increases: France, Germany, and the United Kingdom exhibit rapid early increases, which later stabilize.
- Gradual Increases: The United States and Russia show more consistent and gradual increases.
- Low Increases: China maintains a low infection rate with slight growth.
- Decline: India shows an unusual decline to zero by 2024.

**Visualization 5**: *Countries With less than 50% Vaccination By 2024?* \
This World Map provides a global overview of vaccination rates, highlighting countries projected to have less than 50% vaccination coverage by 2024. Using a color scale from green to red, it visually categorizes countries based on their vaccination rates, with green indicating highest coverage near the 50% mark and red denotes those with the lowest. The legend, positioned on the upper right, spans from 0.00% to 49.26%, offering a clear understanding of the color-coded data.

The map emphasizes regions like Africa, Asia, and parts of Eastern Europe, where many countries fall below the 50% threshold, Labels identify key countries such as Afghanistan, the Central African Republic, and Papua New Guinea. The interactive elements, such as the map selector, likely allow users to explore different views, enhancing the map's utility for stakeholders.

**Visualization 6**: *Covid-19 Full Vaccination Coverage Worldwide By 2024?* \
This World Map provides a global overview of projected full vaccination rates by 2024. The map uses a color gradient from red to green to depict vaccination coverage, where green represents regions with near-complete or 100% coverage, and red highlights areas with minimal or no coverage.

Countries in North America, Europe, and parts of Asia are predominantly shown in green, indicating high vaccination rates, while parts of Africa and the Middle East are marked in shades of red and orange, reflecting lower coverage levels. The legend in the top right corner explains the color range from 0.0% to 100.0%, the map also includes an interactive element labeled “Map Selector”, suggesting options for switching between different views.

**Visualization 7**: *Vaccinations Administered till May 1, 2024 - India* \
This line chart tracks the cumulative number of COVID-19 vaccinations administered in India over time, from November 2019 to May 2024. The chart features three distinct lines, each representing a different vaccination measure: the first dose administered (in red), the second dose administered (in blue), and the Total doses administered (in yellow). The x-axis displays the date, while the y-axis depicts the cumulative number of vaccinations in millions.

Key Observations:
- First Dose Administered: The red line shows a sharp rise starting in early 2021, plateauing around 1.4 billion by mid-2022, indicating a rapid initial rollout of the first doses.
- Second Dose Administered: The blue line, which starts later in 2021, reaches around 790 million by May 2024, showing a slower but steady increase compared to the first dose.
- Total Doses Administered: The yellow line, representing the total number of doses administered, it mirrors the trend of the first dose line initially but then stabilizes, reaching over 2.2 billion by May 2024.

This visualization effectively communicates the progress and scale of India’s vaccination campaign, highlighting the significant difference between the number of first doses administered and the number of second doses administered by May 2024.

**Conclusion**

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted countries around the globe, with varying infection rates and trends. This project has analyzed and visualized COVID-19 data to better understand the spread and severity of the virus across different regions and the Vaccination efforts of each Country.
